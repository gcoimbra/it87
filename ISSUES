===============================

The driver is known to not build for v2.6.32 kernels. Exact errors are unknown,
though it is likely that kernel API functions are incompatible or not supported
in v2.6.32. Patches to fix the problem will be accepted as long as they are
implemented in compat.h.

===============================================================

Jaka Jaksic reports that after resuming from suspend to memory on Gigabyte

is loaded or not. Analysis shows that some chip registers have a wrong value
after resume. The working assumption is that there is a BIOS problem.
There is no known workaround.
